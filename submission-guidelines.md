# Submission Guidelines and Expectations

## Formatting
The list is formatted using Markdown. For a refresher on Markdown, see [Basic Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). Basically, the text you want to serve as a link goes in brackets, and the URL itself follows immediately inside parentheses. 

- For all links, please keep the lists in alphabetical order.
- For blog posts, please list the name of the author rather than the title of the post.
- For tweets, please include the author's name (if available) and username along with a link to the tweet.
- For videos, please include the title of the video and the author's name or username.

If you are adding wishlist items to any of the main categories, be as detailed as possible and please check your spelling and punctuation. It is perfectly fine to add items that contradict other items on the list. If you want to attach your name to your wish, you may do so by putting it in parenthesis at the end. 

For example,
- The ability to view and configure Smart Mailboxes in Mail for iOS. (Becky Hansmeyer)

## Conduct
While it may be tempting to add a little snark to your wishes, especially when they've been on your list for like 10 years and Apple *still* hasn't addressed them, please save the snark for a blog post and make the contributions here as professional as possible.

Be kind and treat others as you would want to be treated.

Finally, please try to keep this document focused on things that would actually be announced at WWDC. If you have wishes for Apple's supply chain, or its environmental impact, or the diversity of its workforce, this is not the place for those kinds of wishes. :)
